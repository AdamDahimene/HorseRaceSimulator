Horse Race Simulator

Part 1 code:
To run this code I have created a Main.java file which contains the main method which is run first. Firstly, go to the terminal or command prompt for Windows users. Go to the directory of the folder then compile the Main.java by running javac Main.java. After compiling, run the program by running Java Main in the terminal. This will then run part 1 of the code.

Part 2 code:
To run part 2, I have created also a Java file in part 2 folder. To run this program you need to go to the same directory and cd into Part 2 folder. In here you can go to the terminal and compile main which will compile all files inside of part 2. After compiling all files in part 2 you can then run in the terminal java Main.
This will load up the GUI for the user to enter the distance of the track and how many horses they would like to have. After this the GUI will ask to customise the horses by name, character and confidence. Once you have submitted all the data then the race will start in the terminal
